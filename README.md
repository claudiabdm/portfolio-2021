# My Portfolio

Multilingual **JAMstack** site built with **Nuxt 3**, styled with **SCSS** (BEM methodology) and deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**. I used **Storyblok** CMS and its image service to create responsive images. I also learnt **GSAP** while creating the site so most animation are made with it.

## Build Setup

> **Warning**
>
>This repo was not intended to be a template. It does not work out of the box and you will need to replace Storyblok related stuff, use your own credentials, etc. To do so, you might need to be familiar with Storyblok and Nuxt.js but I am planning on improving this after migrating to Nuxt 3.


```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at https://localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production
$ npm run build

# generate static project
$ npm run generate

# locally preview production build
$ npm run preview
```

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.
